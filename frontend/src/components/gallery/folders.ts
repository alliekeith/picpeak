 * mounting the gallery, and so every layout shares one definition of "what is
 * visible right now".
 *
 * NOTE: folders are organisational, not access control. A foldered photo is
 * still served by the same per-photo auth as any other; hiding it from the root
 * grid does not make its URL unreachable.
