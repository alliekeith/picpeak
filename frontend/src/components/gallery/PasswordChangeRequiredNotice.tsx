/**
 * Shown when a gallery admin preview is refused with 403 MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD.
 *
 * The generic states around it are both wrong for this case: "failed to load"
 * offers a Retry that can never succeed, and "gallery not found" is untrue.
 * The admin area already handles the flag with a blocking password-change
 * dialog (AdminLayout), so this only has to send them there.
 *
 * The same notice covers a preview refused with 401 SESSION_TIMEOUT: the admin
 * session idled out, and the way back is signing in again.
 *
 * A plain link rather than a router navigation: the gallery applied its own
 * theme to the document, and a full load leaves it behind.
