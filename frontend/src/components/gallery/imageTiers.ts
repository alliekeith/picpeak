 * preview tier is a single 1920px JPEG, but a phone can display ~1170px at
 * most — so every lightbox swipe pulls roughly twice the pixels it can use,
 * and the lightbox prefetches neighbours, which multiplies it.
 *
 * The widths mirror the backend whitelist (imageProcessor.js). They are
 * duplicated rather than fetched because they are a contract, not
 * configuration: a value the server does not recognise is ignored and the
 * default tier served, so drift degrades to today's behaviour rather than
 * breaking. The backend test pins the same lists.

 * emitting either. The preview route generates lazily and redirects to the
 * original on any failure, so nothing here can show less than it does today.
