/**
 * One row per external file per event (#1162).
 *
 * The import route used to check for an existing external_relpath and then
 * insert, with an fs.stat and a Sharp decode in between — wide enough that two
 * overlapping imports both walked through it. A reporter's event held 8004 rows
 * for 6012 distinct paths.
 *
 * This lives in a service rather than inside migration 186 because it has two
 * callers. The migration is one. The other is a .picpeak restore: the archive
 * carries the photos table verbatim, so a backup taken before this fix lands
 * duplicate rows into a schema that now has a unique index on them — and
 * neither Postgres' `session_replication_role = replica` nor SQLite's
 * `defer_foreign_keys` disables a UNIQUE index, so batchInsert would abort the
 * whole restore after every table had already been emptied.
 *
 * DELETING dependent rows explicitly, rather than trusting ON DELETE CASCADE,
 * is the load-bearing part. Every FK into photos declares CASCADE, but PicPeak
 * does not set `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` — the codebase says so in as many
 * words where it deletes an event (adminEvents/helpers.js:245-249) — so on
 * every SQLite install the cascade is inert and a bare delete would leave
 * dangling feedback and marks behind. The same reason
 * `hero_photo_id` is repointed by hand: its SET NULL is inert there too, so
 * without it a SQLite install keeps a hero pointing at a row that is gone.
 *
 * Guest and admin state is MOVED to the survivor where it can be, not
 * discarded. The duplicates were separate tiles in the grid, so a guest's
 * comment or an admin's rating could legitimately be attached to either, and
 * silently deleting it inside a fix for silent data loss would be its own bug.
 * Where the target already holds an equivalent row — the same guest's like on
 * the same photo, the same admin's mark, the same transfer's entry — the loser
 * is dropped instead, because those tables mean "one per (photo, actor)" and
 * moving would either violate a unique constraint or double-count.
