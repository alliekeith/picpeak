 * Backfill orientation for a library that predates #1185 (#1198).
 *
 * The orientation fix corrected the generators and every ingest path, but did
 * nothing for photos already in the database. Those rows are worse off than
 * untouched ones in one specific way: before the fix a rotated photo was
 * CONSISTENTLY wrong — a sideways image in a tile shaped to match. Afterwards
 * the regenerated thumbnail is correct while photos.width/height still
 * describe the raw sensor order, so masonry and justified size a portrait
 * photo with a landscape ratio.
 *
 * The dimension repair above cannot reach them: it only selects rows with a
 * NULL dimension, and an affected row has both — just transposed.
 *
 * Its own job rather than a mode of that one, because it does strictly more:
 * where the EXIF transform means the pixels have moved, the derived images and
 * face data generated against the old orientation are no longer valid and have
 * to be invalidated with the write.
