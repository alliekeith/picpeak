/**
 * Admin → System Health
 *
 * Endpoint mounted at /api/admin/system-health. The "Backup
 * integrity" sub-endpoint is the on-demand verifier for CRM
 * document artefacts — confirms every `*_path` column on quotes /
 * contracts / invoices points at a file that actually exists on
 * disk and (where a `*_sha256` column is set) the file's bytes
 * still hash to the expected value.
 *
 * Per the design decisions locked with the maintainer:
 *   - On-demand only; no scheduler (D1)
 *   - Not auto-triggered after restore (D2)
 *   - Wet-upload contracts are hash-verified same as system-rendered (D3)
 *
 * Read-only. Returns a JSON report — never mutates DB or fs.

 * instead is no fix either, since knex hands sqlite3 a Date the same way and
 * jest's sandbox Dates stringify to "[object Object]" (see CLAUDE.md).
 *
 * The time filtering happens in JS, so the candidate rows have to be paged
 * rather than cut off with a single LIMIT: a queue holding a thousand
 * future-scheduled rows (split-payment invoices) would otherwise fill one page
 * with rows that all get filtered out and hide the due row behind them,
 * reporting an empty waiting list. Paging also removes the dependency on
 * ORDER BY created_at being meaningful, which it is not on SQLite when numeric

 * Deliberately does NOT send the mail itself. An earlier revision flushed the
 * row here via processEmailQueue({ onlyId }), which reads better but races:
 * nothing claims a row before the transport is invoked, so a flush overlapping
 * the scheduled pass has both of them sending the same email. Saving 60
 * seconds is not worth a duplicate landing in a customer's inbox.
 *
 * That is also why waiting rows carry no actions at all — they are already
 * pending with retries and schedule clear, so this endpoint would rewrite them
 * to the state they are in and change nothing. What a waiting row needs is the
 * processor fixed, which the panel above it says.
 *
 * KNOWN, deliberate: clearing scheduled_at leaves created_at at the original
 * enqueue time, so a retried old row shows up in the waiting list right away
 * looking overdue, until the processor sends it on its next tick. Restarting
 * that clock needs a timestamp written here, and there is no shape that works:
 * a Date matches how queueEmail writes the column and how processEmailQueue
 * compares it, but jest's sandbox Dates store as "[object Object]" (CLAUDE.md)
 * so it cannot be tested; an ISO string tests fine but stores as TEXT, and
 * SQLite then orders it above the numeric bound in the processor's own pickup
 * query, leaving the row unsendable. A requeued_at column would settle it.
 * Cosmetic either way, and not worth risking a stuck row for.
